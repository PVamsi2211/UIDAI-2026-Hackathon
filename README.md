Dataset

Datasets are not included in this repository.

You must find and upload the required dataset(s) into the data/ directory before training.

Ensure the dataset format matches the expectations defined in the training code.

Training the Model

The repository already contains all necessary code for training the anomaly detection model.

Once the dataset is placed in the data/ folder, you can directly run the training script as provided in the source code.

Notes

Dataset preprocessing and model configuration are handled within the existing codebase.

Modify paths or parameters only if your dataset structure differs.

Acknowledgment

This project was created specifically for UIDAI Hackathon 2026.
